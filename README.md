NotificationCompat2
===================

An extension of the `NotificationCompat` helper in the support library which
actually supports all of the features of the Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) release.

This library is meant as a standalone replacement. Change your import from
`android.support.v4.app.NotificationCompat` to
`com.jakewharton.notificationcompat2.NotificationCompat2`.

Downloadable .jars can be found on the [GitHub download page][1].
